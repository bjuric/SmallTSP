Small TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem)
=======================================

-----------
Description
-----------

Given a set of legs of form:

  ([A-Z]{2})(\d+) 

    where:
  
    ([A-Z]{2}) is a path from an origin to a destination
                 - the first character is the origin
                 - the second character is the destination
         (\d+) is the unit distance between the origin and destination

This program solves the following problems:

 1. The distance of route ABC
 2. The distance of route AD 
 3. The distance of route ADC
 4. The distance of route AEBCD
 5. The distance of route AED
 6. All routes starting at C and ending at C with a maximum of 3 legs
 7. All routes starting at A and ending at C with exactly 4 legs
 8. The shortest route (in terms of distance) from A to C
 9. The shortest route (in terms of distance) from B to B
10. All routes from C to C with a distance of less than 30 units

Yields the following output:

 1. Distance of route ABC = 9
 2. Distance of route AD = 5
 3. Distance of route ADC = 13
 4. Distance of route AEBCD = 22
 5. Distance of route AED = No such route: Path ED does not exist
 6. Routes from C to C having at most 3 stops = CDC, CEBC
 7. Routes from A to C having exactly 4 stops = ABCDC, ADEBC, ADCDC
 8. Shortest route from A to C = ABC
 9. Shortest route from B to B = BCEB
10. Routes from C to C having distance less than 30 = CDEBC, CDC, CDCEBC, CEBC, CEBCDC, CEBCEBC, CEBCEBCEBC
